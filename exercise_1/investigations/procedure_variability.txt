Answering the question “Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?” I found that the top ten procedures in terms of score variability are the following:

measureid		measurename																stddev_score
OP_23			Head CT results																0.20700553132826133
OP_2			Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival										0.1845734228688155
STK_4			Thrombolytic Therapy															0.16578280846973972
HF_1			Discharge instructions															0.16140559017907308
IMM_3_OP_27_FAC_ADHPCT	Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination												0.1505625306775663
CAC_3			Home Management Plan of Care Document													0.14494265770792772
PC_01			Percent of newborns whose deliveries were scheduled early (1-3 weeks early), when a scheduled delivery was not medically necessary	0.13998878657698174
VTE_5			Warfarin therapy discharge instructions													0.1375788542625326
VTE_1			Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis													0.12531727017667355
OP_1			Median Time to Fibrinolysis														0.12390823030302539

My conclusion is that the above procedures have the most variability among qualifying procedures (I have minimal insight into what can be inferred from the top procedures by variability).

Similar to the analysis for best_hospitals, I excluded from calculations of the average score those scores that were ‘not available’ as well as those scores that did not translate to an integer value. I also excluded from the ranking those procedures that did not have a significant sample of scored hospitals (30 or more). Most procedures had a significant sample of scored hospitals (Only 2 of the 63 total procedures were excluded from the ranking).

Please note that the normalization of scores is identical to that in the best_hospitals analysis as the same normalized data is underlying the analysis (particularly note that the same refinement described in best_hospitals.txt would apply).
